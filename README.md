# CNN-model-for-Emotion-Recognition-in-Python
Built and trained a CNN model which recognizes facial expressions after training it on training dataset. 

For the emotion recognition model I used kaggle dataset ‘Face expression recognition dataset’. The dataset consists of images of 7 emotions – Angry, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Fear, Disguise and Neutral. Out of the 7 emotions images, I took 5 emotions dataset- Angry, Happy, Sad, Surprise and Neutral. For training the CNN model I used 70% of images of each emotion and for validation 30% of images of each emotion. For the testing purpose, through an input image, I tested it through random image of any of the emotions.
The aim of my model was to recognize emotions (Angry, Happy, Sad, Surprise and Neutral) on test image as well as on live video feed after training the model.
